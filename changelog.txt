// Jason: I moved the queue_family_indices stuff to renderer, 
// because it didn't seem to make sense to require a physical device reference to call a function which passes in itself as an argument.
// e.g. "mRenderer->find_queue_families(mPhysicalDevice);"
// instead of "mPhysicalDevice->find_queue_families(mPhysicalDevice);"
// 
// I also added a logical_device class, as well as a member pointer for it in renderer.
// I also changed the member physical_device reference to a pointer. Feel like this is better for passing between classes.
// Let me know if this is the right call or not.
